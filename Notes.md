Make a nested form (this should probably have html <label>s so it makes sense to a user). This form will be creating three objects (one instance of the Pirate class, and two instances of the Ship class). Remember, you'll need to build a corresponding controller action to load this page. Your form should POST to the route '/pirates'.

After a user clicks submit they should be taken to a page that displays all the information we just posted from the form. You should have a page that shows the pirate you created along with their ships and all the details about the pirate and their ships.
